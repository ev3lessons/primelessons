        <span>PrimeLessons.org was founded by Sanjay and Arvind Seshan, two undergraduates at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) while they were still in middle/high school. Since the launch of MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor in the fall of 2020, the site also supports users of MINDSTORMS 51515. The founders have a long history of creating and sharing educational curriculum and resources. Their goal is to provide open-source, high-quality lessons to students, teachers and robotics teams everywhere. Prime Lessons is affiliated with EV3Lessons.com which is the premier site for learning to program the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3. 
            Prime Lessons is run by a 501(c)(3), <a href="http://www.droidsrobotics.org/">Droids Robotics</a>. Everything shared on PrimeLessons is provided free of charge. If you wish to support the site in any way, please email (team@ev3lessons.com). <br></span>
